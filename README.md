# YOUR PROJECT TITLE
Go Weather
#### Video Demo:  <URL https://youtu.be/YFcq2mPdgng>
#### Description:
The final project is a weather application.
Designed from html, css, js, and also Python, and the way to use it is very easy,
and everything is explained within the application,
as well as in the section link.
And to shorten the project for you just write any country or city to know the temperature
and also the percentage of humidity and wind speed.

Weather.HTML(Index) \ weather.Js:
This is the only file that was linked to the JavaScript file, which in turn helped me create the weather application,
so the Java file was for me just a name that will be called to the interface of the (openweathermap) site from
taking the API key code, and that is easy for me to step because it was at the beginning difficult for me.

weather.ico:
It was the easiest thing for me, so I just uploaded a picture of Google to be the logo of Icon at the top of the sites,
as I saw in the finance project, and this is what made my site more beautiful,
so on every html page I put  code weather icon to beautify my application

Images: All the images inside it were randomly downloaded from Google as well, so it is designed to put it in
JavaScript in case the atmosphere of the cases fluctuates, so it was to make my application more beautiful because
before that it was without pictures, so I thought it was not enough, so I added the pictures

Note.Html \ map.html:
It is just an assistant only to understand my program and also to know areas to try it and all that is in that it
is an addition that makes it easier for the user to understand my application.
(Note)!! In case you ask why I didn't put both the note and the map in the same page as the main one,
then it was not bad because it takes up a lot of space and makes the site uglier.

App.py: It was just an assistant only and I did not write much about it because I did not use SQL and this
is because my application does not help him and as you can see in the file it is simplified

Style.css: Design was the hardest thing I faced and it took about 8 hours of my time in the project,
meaning 40% of my time from the project, and as you can see, the file is very long,
but I shortened each file box to be easy to understand,
and I also took help in the design from the projects that we designed in CS50 before and also from Google as well.

In the end, the design of my site was simplified and I did not take it seriously, so I believe that I could have worked
more than that, but it was better to simplify the project as much as I learned from CS50, thank you.

The project took about 20 hours of time, including the time it took to solve problems.
